# Developing Flickker - A Full-Stack Clothing Website

This is my final-year project. I utilized all the technologies and programming languages I had learned, those I was more comfortable with, and those that interested me. I created a website designed to mimic an online clothing store.

The PDF file contains the project report, including all the concepts, problem definitions, and relevant diagrams that aided in the development of the website.
